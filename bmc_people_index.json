Perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, he developed a radically abstract style of painting that fused Cubism, Surrealism and Expressionism. While many of his colleagues moved from figuration to abstraction, de Kooning always painted figures, most notably women, and abstractions concurrently, making no distinction between the art historical categories. De Kooning's real subject, he insisted, was space and the figure-ground relation. De Kooning fused abstraction, figuration, and landscapes in various ways throughout the many long decades of his career, and his unceasing journey to find new forms and subjects made his overall output more eclectic than most of his colleagues. His engagement with popular culture was also unique and informed a host of post-war artists from the Neo-Dadaism of Robert Rauschenberg to the Pop Art of James Rosenquist, and younger painters such as Cecily Brown have explored the gestural eroticism of his later paintings.",

In 1984-85 she walked across the United States, as well as from Western Europe to Eastern Europe on the Walk for the People to promote peace and nuclear disarmament. Afterwards, she moved to the north Georgia mountains to continue her activism surrounded by nature. With her friend Joanne Steele, she co-founded ACE: Action for a Clean Environment, which waged successful campaigns against landfills and a medical incinerator, as well as raising awareness on many other environmental issues. An active member and for several years co-convener of the NE Georgia Peace Council, as well as WAND (Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament), Nuclear Watch South, and the Workers Circle, Adele worked tirelessly for peace and justice. She was a frequent letter writer to local newspapers and participated in many demonstrations, some annually such as the Kings Bay Trident submarine base and the School for the Americas. She was an insatiable reader, devout vegetarian, and possessed a quick wit and superb intellect. An avid folk dancer, she credited dancing with preparing her well for her year and a half long Walk for the People. Having learned piano as a child, she maintained a love and practice of music, singing with the Atlanta Choral Guild under Robert Shaw and the Collegium Musicum community chorus at Emory University. In her 80s, she began painting in watercolors, writing poetry and her memoirs, and making spectacular mosaics.  Alternative Name: Adele Kushner",

While in the service, he regularly sent updates to the Community bulletins of his time away. Though there isn't much information accessible to share facts of his life while a student or shortly after, one can see that he had a love for storytelling when looking through the College bulletins. He even mentions in one that he was writing articles, essays, and fiction, and hoping to have someone look over his work. Henry returned to complete his senior evaluations at BMC until 1947. He requested transfer records from the college to be sent to the University of Chicago, University of Michigan, Duke University, and Harvard University in 1949. He wrote to the college in 1951 from Durham, NC so it is assumed that he attended Duke University for his MA. He asked for another round of transcripts to be sent in 1953 to Washington University, University of Kentucky, Purdue University, and the University of Buffalo where he wished to continue in the study of Psychology.",

It was also suggested that studies and sleeping quarters be combined in small units, as shown in Don Wight\u2019s drawings. After much discussion, the latter idea was rejected, but as the consensus of opinion in the community was strongly in favor of a small dormitory to be built first rather than a large one, the campaign to raise funds for the latter was suspended and the whole matter postponed until a new plan could be made.\"",

The family traveled widely, and Adele immersed herself in her art, whether it was painting scenes of everyday life in Saudi Arabia or filming and acting as editor and producer of homemade documentary films in both Saudi Arabia and Libya. Adele and Maury moved to Winston-Salem, N.C., after leaving Libya following Maury\u2019s retirement, and Adele ultimately worked in Wake Forest University\u2019s alumni office until her own retirement in early 1999, more than nine years after her husband\u2019s death in December 1989.
